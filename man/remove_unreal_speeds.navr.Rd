\title{Shorthand for picking speeds and then recalculating object}
\usage{
\method{remove_unreal_speeds}{navr}(obj, cutoff = NULL, type = NULL,
  remove_distance = T, total_recalculate = T, indices = c(),
  replacement = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{cutoff}{cutoff value. see `pick_unreal_speeds`}

\item{type}{what type of cutoof. see `pick_unreal_speeds`}

\item{remove_distance}{shoudl the distances be removed? in case unreal speeds are probably due to "teleportation" or bad measurements,
jumpy tracking etc,  then the participant didn't really travel that distance and we can remove it. In case the unreal distances are caused
by parts of the tracking missing, then the distances travelled are actually correct, just the speeds are not. *Defaults* to TRUE}

\item{total_recalculate}{if true, recalculates total_distance column to reflect removed distances, *defaults* to TRUE}

\item{indices}{indices of speeds to clean out in case they were obtained separately.
If empty, `type`, `cutoff` need to be defined and `pick_unreal_speeds` is called}

\item{replacement}{what to replace  unreal speeds with. *Defaults* to NA}
}
\description{
Picks unreal speeds in the same way as `pick_unreal_speed` but then removes
given lines form the data, replaces them as per replacement parameter and returnes cleaned
object
}

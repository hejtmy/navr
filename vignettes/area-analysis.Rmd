# Area analysis

Areas define places within the space in which the subject can be at any point. It allows us to segment the environemnt to predefined spaces (e.g. starting zone, target zone) and analyse thte time spent at each of those spaces or number of visits during the experiment.

## Area Objects

Areas are defined by `AreaObject` object, which has name, type and other values. 

```{r}

```
